          <p>Candidates have to decide over a year before the national election if they want to run. They do this by testing the waters and creating exploratory committees to determine if they have a chance of actually winning the nomination. </p>

          <p>Once a candidate receives $5,000 in donations or spends $5,000 on their campaign they must register with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The FEC was established by congress in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1975 to regulate campaign financing. Since the first election, the amount spent on elections has drastically increased. In turn it has caused a lot of controversy about whether or not candidates should be allowed to spend unlimited amounts of money on campaigning. </p>

In a couple of states they use both both one party may use the primary and the other uses the cuacus.
